1. I made a /var/ftp/pub/yum/rhel6/repodata directory
2. I copied all the rpm packages and *comps*.xml from the dvd to repodata.
3. I instaled deltarpm,python-deltarpm and createrepo rpm packages.
4. I generated local repository in rhel6 directory.
5. Then I created server.repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d and set the
appropriate values.
6. I had to remove the redhat's repo file from there, it didn't allow
me to configure.
7. Then I did a yum clean all and yum makecache.

Finally,the server became ready .

I tested the server by installing squid package before and after
